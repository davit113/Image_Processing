my thoughts:

1. main creates windows and binds functions of other modules to buttons
2. captureImage upon pressing button opens camera and captures image. // (stores it to variable, returns which then main should display)
3. findTarget takes img and does something which finds target type and target location and returns it //  maybe like {type, location}
4. calculate distance calculates distance and and displays it next to object (inside image)
5. targetSize calculates target size(pixel count (probably)) and  displays it next to object (inside image)


notes:
1. 4 and 5 could be combined but for now let it be.
2. we should aim main module to be short, with <100 lines of code, 
    so i am thinking of creating anothen module which creates windows, and binds functions. main should be just same definitons and start catalist
3. code folder should be in as one module. It shoud not need 4 import like right now :  import calcDistance as dis
                                                                                        import captureImage as cap
                                                                                        import findTarget as ftar
                                                                                        import targetSize as tsize
